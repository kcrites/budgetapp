Documentation

This app allows you to enter in income and expenses for the month. You can see a list of the items for the month and the percentage of each expense against the total income. Each item can be deleted as well.

The app displays the total budget at the top of the app. This is a total of income and expenses.

The app was written in a combination of ES5 and ES6 JavaScript and is slowly being refactored to pure ES6.
